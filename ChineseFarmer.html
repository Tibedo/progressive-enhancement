    <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. </p>
    <p>From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. </p>
    <p>Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p>
    
    
      <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. </p>
      <p>Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. </p>
      <p>That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. </p>
      <p>If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. </p>
      <p>Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>
    
      <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. </p>
      <p>Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. </p>
      <p>But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. </p>
      <p>Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

      <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
      <p> They said, “<em>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</em>” </p>
      <p>The farmer said, “<em>Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</em>” </p>
    </section>
<br>
      <section class="sec3">
      <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “<em>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</em>” </p>
      <p>The farmer again said, “<em>Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</em>” </p>

    </section>

    <section class="sec4">
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
     <p>The neighbors then said, “<em>Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</em>” </p>
    </section>

     <section class="sec5">
     <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
     <p> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “<em>Isn’t that great!</em>” Again, he said, “<em>Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</em>”</p>

  <p> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>
