        <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. </p>
        <p>From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.
        </p>
        <p>Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p>


        <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. </p>
        <p>Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
          changes. </p>
        <p>That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. </p>
        <p>If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
          on that way. </p>
        <p>Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>

        <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. </p>
        <p>Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself
          differently. </p>
        <p>But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. </p>
        <p>Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it
          anyway.</p>

      <b class="farmerpic">Caption:</b> <em>"The Old Chinese Farmer"</em>

      <p class="narrative"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
        around to commiserate.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> They said, <em class="neighbors">"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate."</em> </p>
      <p class="narrative">The farmer said, <em class="farmer">"Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know."</em> </p>

      <br>

      <p class="narrative">The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
        said, <em class="neighbors">"Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!"</em>
      </p>
      <p class="narrative">The farmer again said, <em class="farmer">"Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know."</em> </p>


      <br>

      <p class="narrative">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg.</p>
      <p class="narrative">The neighbors then said, <em class="neighbors">"Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em> and the farmer responded,<em
          class="farmer"> “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know."</em> </p>

      <br>

      <p class="narrative">The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
        because he had a broken leg.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> Again all the neighbors came around and said, <em class="neighbors">"Isn’t that great!"</em> Again, he said,
        <em class="farmer">"Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know."</em></p>
